    <ul>
      <li>When I was updating addItem, I was having trouble with scope (I think?).
          Once I moved my isFull function above addItem it all worked fine. Is there
          a way to have done this while leaving isFull at the bottom of the code like
          it was in my earlier commit?</li>
      <li>Another updated addItem question: In my earlier commits, I was checking if
          the last item in basket equaled 'item' that had been added. It worked, but
          as I was testing the update I realized that if you just added a bunch of the same
          item, it would still return true even though the adding cutoff part still worked.
          You can see my fix for checking basket length, is there a "standard" way to check
          inside a function about whether it "functioned"?</li>
    </ul>
